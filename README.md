Soccer Analytics

This repository houses Python scripts for scraping, cleaning, and visualizing data.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed for various data-related tasks, including web scraping, data cleaning, and data visualization. These scripts are intended to assist users who posses some python knowledge in efficiently gathering soccer data from various online sources, processing it to ensure its quality, and creating informative visualizations to gain insight on player and team peformance.

## Installation

Currently the repositoriy mostly consists of Jupyter Notebooks.

To install Jupyter Notebook, which is essential for running our Python code, you have a couple of straightforward options:

- **Direct Download from Project Jupyter**: Visit [Project Jupyter | Installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) and follow the provided instructions. Within moments, you'll have Jupyter Notebook ready for use.
  
- **Anaconda Distribution**: Alternatively, you can opt to install Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda, a comprehensive environment for managing your coding projects. Visit [Free Download | Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to get started. While this method involves a few additional steps, Anaconda offers clear guidance throughout the process.

You can also set up an enviroment for notebooks in visual studio code. Here is a detailed guide.
